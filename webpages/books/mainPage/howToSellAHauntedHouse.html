                    Grady Hendrix takes on the haunted house in a thrilling new novel that explores the way your
                    pastâ€”and your familyâ€”can haunt you like nothing else.

                    When Louise finds out her parents have died, she dreads going home. She doesn't want to leave her
                    daughter with her ex and fly to Charleston. She doesn't want to deal with her family home, stuffed
                    to the rafters with the remnants of her father's academic career and her mother's lifelong obsession
                    with puppets and dolls. She doesn't want to learn how to live without the two people who knew and
                    loved her best in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of all, she doesn't want to deal with her brother, Mark, who never left their hometown, gets
                    fired from one job after another, and resents her success. Unfortunately, she'll need his help to
                    get the house ready for sale because it'll take more than some new paint on the walls and clearing
                    out a lifetime of memories to get this place on the market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But some houses don't want to be sold, and their home has other plans for both of themâ€¦

                            <p>This is honestly one of the worst books I've ever have had the misfortune of reading. I
                                feel so bad that given our current ecological crisis and the massive paper shortage,
                                that even a single tree had to die for this book to be printed. RIP to the trees ðŸŒ²</p>

                                It took a long time to get going, and Louise's brother Mark pissed me off so much I
                                almost gave up.
                                When it finally got into it I was a bit more invested - but still not massively creepy
                                dolls/puppets aren't really my thing. But I did find the reveal where it was their
                                mother's dead brother possessing the puppet to be an interesting take.
                                I finished it, which is something to be said. But I think I might be done with this
