                <p>
                    When mysterious faeries from other realms appear at her university, curmudgeonly professor Emily
                    Wilde must uncover their secrets before it's too late in this heartwarming, enchanting second
                    installment of the Emily Wilde series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emily Wilde is a genius scholar of faerie folklore—she just wrote the world's first comprehensive of
                    encylopaedia of faeries. She's learned many of the secrets of the Hidden Folk on her adventures . .
                    . and also from her fellow scholar and former rival, Wendell Bambleby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because Bambleby is more than infuriatingly charming. He's an exiled faerie king on the run from his
                    murderous mother, and in search of a door back to his realm. So despite Emily's feelings for
                    Bambleby, she's not ready to accept his proposal of marriage. Loving one of the Fair Folk comes with
                    secrets and danger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And she also has a new project to focus a map of the realms of faerie. While she is preparing her
                    research, Bambleby lands her in trouble yet again, when assassins sent by Bambleby's mother invade
                    Cambridge. Now Bambleby and Emily are on another adventure, this time to the picturesque Austrian
                    Alps, where Emily believes they may find the door to Bambley's realm, and the key to freeing him
                    from his family's dark plans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But with new relationships for the prickly Emily to navigate and dangerous Folk lurking in every
                    forest and hollow, Emily must unravel the mysterious workings of faerie doors, and of her own heart.

                            <p>In a Nutshell: A worthy sequel in the Emily Wilde series. Retains most of the feels.
                                Enjoyed it almost as much as Book One. Good for cosy fantasy readers. Can't be read as a
                                standalone. The series doesn't end here!

                                such clever little turns--you're always a step behind emily, and there are few places
