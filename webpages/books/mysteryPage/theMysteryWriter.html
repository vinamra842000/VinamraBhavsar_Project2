                    A literary thriller about an aspiring writer who meets and falls in love with her literary idol—only
                    to find him murdered the day after she gave him her manuscript to read.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's nothing easier to dismiss than a conspiracy theory—until it turns out to be true
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Theodosia Benton abandons her career path as an attorney and shows up on her brother's doorstep
                    with two suitcases and an unfinished novel, she expects to face a few challenges. Will her brother
                    support her ambition or send her back to finish her degree? What will her parents say when they
                    learn of her decision? Does she even have what it takes to be a successful writer?
                </p>
                <p>
                    What Theo never expects is to be drawn into a hidden literary world in which identity is something
                    that can be lost and remade for the sake of an audience. When her mentor, a highly successful
                    author, is brutally murdered, Theo wants the killer to be found and justice to be served. Then the
                    police begin looking at her brother, Gus, as their prime suspect, and Theo does the unthinkable in
                    order to protect him. But the writer has left a trail, a thread out of the labyrinth in the form of
                    a story. Gus finds that thread and follows it, and in his attempt to save his sister he
                    inadvertently threatens the foundations of the labyrinth itself. To protect the carefully
                    constructed narrative, Theo Benton, and everyone looking for her, will have to die.

                            <p>I found The Mystery Writer difficult since I don't enjoy reading about conspiracy
                                theories, doomsday preppers, and an literary agency that fuels false information. I
                                won't get into the plot. The blurb on the back of the story gives away too much as it
                                is. I never fully invested in the characters because of the over-the-top story. The
                                story ends with a set-up for a sequel since one of the antagonists gets away.</p>

                            <p>The old adage says that you should write what you know, and Sulari Gentill has taken that
                                to heart in her most recent two novels, The Woman in the Library, and now, The Mystery
                                Writer. Gentill definitely knows how to construct a clever and entertaining novel
                                featuring writers, and in this one, the publishing industry as well.

                                The Mystery Writer is the third stand-alone novel by award-winning, best-selling
                                Australian author, Sulari Gentill. When Theodosia Benton arrives at her older brother,
                                Gus’s home in Lawrence, Kansas, having abandoned her law course in Canberra, she’s not
                                sure of the reception she’ll get. But Gus doesn’t let her down: he’s thoroughly
                                understanding and happy for her to stay.
