                        <p>Deep in a hamlet in the Warwickshire countryside, Red Hollow Hall is a male-only sanitorium
                            run by the charismatic psychiatrist Dr Moon. However, all is not well, and Dr Moon's
                            patients are leaving Red Hollow in droves.</p>
                        <p>Recent disturbances, which originally appeared to be pranks, have descended into something
                            more sinister, and now the men believe they have a malevolent visitor - the mermaid of Red
                            Hollow. The ghost of a murdered girl, they believe the mermaid wreaks bloody revenge on
                            unsuspecting men each time the hamlet floods.</p>
                        <p>When Private Enquiry agent, William Garrett, and freshly minted detective, Phyll Hall, are
                            called in to uncover the identity of the intruder, they become trapped in a world of
                            madness, the occult and grisly murder. A world where William must use all his strength to
                            differentiate between the real-life monster haunting Red Hollow Hall and the monsters of the
                            mind.</p>

                            haunting mystery about the fate of women and girls in the orbit of self-important men. Set
                            in November 1918 on the opulent, castle-like island estate of an eccentric millionaire,
                            Claude Arkel, this atmospheric, compellingly readable novel reimagines the life of Anna
                            Filing Fort‚Äïwhose husband, Charles Hoy Fort, was the most famous ‚Äúanomalist‚Äù of the early
                            twentieth century. </p>
                        <p>Settling in as guests on Prosper Island, the young couple find themselves quarantined in a
                            shabby outpost far from Mr. Arkel's mansion‚Äïfrom which, they learn, three girls have gone
                            missing. After she encounters a figure in the woods that may be the ghost of her long-lost
                            friend Mary, Anna resolves to find out who Mr. Arkel really is, and what has become of the
                            missing girls. A contemporary feminist tale with the mood and mystery of a classic gothic
                            novel, King Nyx reintroduces readers, twenty-five years after her acclaimed debut, to one of
                            our most astonishingly imaginative storytellers.</p>

                        <p>
                            Soon, Jim and Frank are sucked into a seedy world of crime and corruption, where no one is
                            safe and nothing is what it seems. Then Jim is violently attacked and one of his operatives
                            turns up dead within the span of twelve hours, and his search for the truth yields a web of
                            lies and a mounting death toll. As he and Frank are pulled deeper into the city's dark

                            about Omaha and his place in it.

                            house is not a run-down farmhouse but a stately mansion, and that her parents died there.
