                            at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple
                            seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh
                            birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some
                            astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of
                            Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!

                        <p>In this gorgeous stand-alone fantasy romance perfect for fans of Margaret Rogerson and
                            Allison Saft, a rebellious witch undertakes a last-ditch quest to restore magic to medieval
                            Wales‚Äîas two princes vie for her heart.</p>
                        <p>Ffion is the last hedgewitch in Foxhall. To work her magic, she takes only what nature can
                            spare, unlike the witches of the powerful Foxhall coven, who sacrifice whole forests to fuel
                            their spells. But across the warring kingdoms of Wales, all magic is fading. Even the
                            dragons have vanished.</p>
                        <p>Prince Taliesin would love nothing more than to watch magic die. But when his father charges
                            Tal and his brother, Dafydd, with destroying King Offa's dyke‚Äîthe massive earthen wall
                            raised by their Mercian enemies to the east, which may be the cause of magic's
                            disappearance‚Äîhe begrudgingly seeks aid from a witch.

                        <p>Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes deep into the well of his imagination in this
                            spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world
                            where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher‚Äîfor their world or ours.
                        </p>
                        <p>Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent
                            student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he
                            was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself‚Äîand
                            his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog
                            in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the backyard is a locked shed from which strange
                            sounds emerge, as if some creature is trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves
                            Charlie the house, a massive amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is
                            impossible to believe, and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to shoulder.</p>
                        <p>
                            Because within the shed is a portal to another world‚Äîone whose denizens are in peril and
                            whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel universe,
                            where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling palace pierce the
                            clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific punishments; there are
                            dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight each other to the death for the
                            amusement of the ‚ÄúFair One.‚Äù And there is a magic sundial that can turn back time.

                            Elspeth Spindle needs more than luck to stay safe in the eerie, mist-locked kingdom of

                            Blunder from the dark magic infecting it. And the highwayman? He just so happens to be the
                            King's nephew, Captain of the most dangerous men in Blunder‚Ä¶and guilty of high treason.
