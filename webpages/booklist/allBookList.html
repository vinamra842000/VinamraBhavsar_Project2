                            run by the charismatic psychiatrist Dr Moon. However, all is not well, and Dr Moon's
                            patients are leaving Red Hollow in droves.</p>
                        <p>Recent disturbances, which originally appeared to be pranks, have descended into something
                            more sinister, and now the men believe they have a malevolent visitor - the mermaid of Red
                            Hollow. The ghost of a murdered girl, they believe the mermaid wreaks bloody revenge on
                            unsuspecting men each time the hamlet floods.</p>

                            madness, the occult and grisly murder. A world where William must use all his strength to

                            mind.</p>

                            Claude Arkel, this atmospheric, compellingly readable novel reimagines the life of Anna

                            twentieth century. </p>
                        <p>Settling in as guests on Prosper Island, the young couple find themselves quarantined in a
                            shabby outpost far from Mr. Arkel's mansion‚Äïfrom which, they learn, three girls have gone
                            missing. After she encounters a figure in the woods that may be the ghost of her long-lost

                            missing girls. A contemporary feminist tale with the mood and mystery of a classic gothic
                            novel, King Nyx reintroduces readers, twenty-five years after her acclaimed debut, to one of

                        <p>The author of What Lies in the Woods returns with a novel about three sisters, two murders,
                            and too many secrets to count.</p>
                        <p>
                            Emma hasn't told her husband much about her past. He knows her parents are dead and she
                            hasn't spoken to her sisters in years. Then they lose their apartment, her husband gets laid
                            off, and Emma discovers she's pregnant‚Äïright as the bank account slips into the red.
                        </p>
                        <p>That's when Emma confesses that she has one more asset: her parents' house, which she owns
                            jointly with her estranged sisters. They can't sell it, but they can live in it. But
                            returning home means that Emma is forced to reveal her secrets to her husband: that the
                            house is not a run-down farmhouse but a stately mansion, and that her parents died there.

                        <p>In this gorgeous stand-alone fantasy romance perfect for fans of Margaret Rogerson and
                            Allison Saft, a rebellious witch undertakes a last-ditch quest to restore magic to medieval
                            Wales‚Äîas two princes vie for her heart.</p>
                        <p>Ffion is the last hedgewitch in Foxhall. To work her magic, she takes only what nature can
                            spare, unlike the witches of the powerful Foxhall coven, who sacrifice whole forests to fuel
                            their spells. But across the warring kingdoms of Wales, all magic is fading. Even the
                            dragons have vanished.</p>
                        <p>Prince Taliesin would love nothing more than to watch magic die. But when his father charges
                            Tal and his brother, Dafydd, with destroying King Offa's dyke‚Äîthe massive earthen wall
                            raised by their Mercian enemies to the east, which may be the cause of magic's
                            disappearance‚Äîhe begrudgingly seeks aid from a witch.

                        <p>Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes deep into the well of his imagination in this
                            spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world
                            where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher‚Äîfor their world or ours.
                        </p>
                        <p>Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent
                            student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he
                            was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself‚Äîand
                            his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog
                            in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the backyard is a locked shed from which strange
                            sounds emerge, as if some creature is trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves
                            Charlie the house, a massive amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is
                            impossible to believe, and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to shoulder.</p>
                        <p>
                            Because within the shed is a portal to another world‚Äîone whose denizens are in peril and
                            whose monstrous leaders may destroy their own world, and ours. In this parallel universe,
                            where two moons race across the sky, and the grand towers of a sprawling palace pierce the
                            clouds, there are exiled princesses and princes who suffer horrific punishments; there are
                            dungeons; there are games in which men and women must fight each other to the death for the
                            amusement of the ‚ÄúFair One.‚Äù And there is a magic sundial that can turn back time.
